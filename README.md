# Web Scraping for E-commerce Product Details

This Python script demonstrates web scraping using BeautifulSoup and requests to extract product details from a sample e-commerce website and stores them in a CSV file. In this example, we are scraping laptop product details from the [Web Scraper Test Sites](https://webscraper.io/test-sites/e-commerce/allinone/computers/laptops) website.

## Prerequisites

Before running the script, make sure you have the following installed:

- Python (3.x recommended)
- Python libraries: BeautifulSoup, requests, pandas

You can install these libraries using pip:

```bash
pip install beautifulsoup4 requests pandas

Usage
Clone this repository or download the script file (scraper.py) to your local machine.

Open the terminal or command prompt and navigate to the directory where the script is located.

Run the script using Python:

Script Details
The script uses BeautifulSoup to parse the HTML content of the target web page.

It extracts product names, prices, and descriptions from the HTML elements.

The extracted data is stored in a pandas DataFrame.

The DataFrame is then saved to a CSV file with the following columns: "Product Name," "Price," and "Description."

Customize
You can modify the url variable to point to a different e-commerce website to scrape different product details.

Customize the parsing logic in the script to match the structure of the target website if needed.
